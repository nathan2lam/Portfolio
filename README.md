#Personal Portfolio

Personal portfolio website used to learn the world of React.

Overview
Components: The "src/Pages/Home/" directory contains all React components that make up the home page. If you explore may find extra componenents that I have created and decided not to keep in the final product, but have too much of an attachment to delete. 
Styling: All styling is contained in App.css
Functionality: This project aims to showcase my own personal projects and skills as a web developer in creating an appealing and functional web page.

Thanks for reading!
